1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
       Block elements change the layout of the text, for example with a <p> element. Inline elements can go within the block elements and don't change the layout, for example the <em> element will only italicize the text.


2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    An element that is positioned absolutely, will be positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor or go along with the document body, scrolling with the page.


3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    I think that you could use the "width" property in CSS to adjust the width.

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.
        display block elements: <p>. <header>, <footer>
        display inline elements: <a>, <em>, <span>
        display inline-block: <img>
 
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
     The box model consists of margins, borders, padding, and the content; which is wrapped around each HTML element. 


6. What is the fix for the box model? 
     box-sizing: border-box
